REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 sdc/ascii_to_font/fr_th/addr_reg_reg has an input control pin sdc/ascii_to_font/fr_th/addr_reg_reg/ADDRARDADDR[3] (net: sdc/ascii_to_font/fr_th/ADDRARDADDR[0]) which is driven by a register (vga/v_count_reg_reg[0]_rep) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
